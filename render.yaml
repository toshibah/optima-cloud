    # Render's default PHP service uses Apache, which will serve your static files
    # (index.html, index.tsx) and execute your PHP scripts correctly.
    # The document root is the project's root directory by default.

    # This project doesn't have a build step (no composer dependencies or frontend asset compilation).
    # We override the default build command to prevent errors.
    buildCommand: "echo 'No build step required. Static assets are served directly.'"
    
    # Explicitly define the start command to run the Apache server.
    # This prevents Render's auto-detection from incorrectly trying to run a Node.js start command.
